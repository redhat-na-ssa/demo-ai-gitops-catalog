The Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit gives data scientists, AI developers, and researchers familiar Python* tools and frameworks to accelerate end-to-end data science and machine learning pipelines on Intel® architectures. The components are built using oneAPI libraries for low-level compute optimizations. This toolkit maximizes performance from preprocessing through machine and deep learning phases and provides interoperability for efficient model development and deployment across single and multinodes.
