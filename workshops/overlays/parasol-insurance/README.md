# Kludge the parasol insurance demo to work efficiently

This demo is:

- hard to reproduce consistently due to gaps in the source repo configuration
- lacks useful documentation around self managed deployment
- inconsistent in the use of automation
- scripts embedded in `yaml` - messy to maintain and contribute
- costs a lot of $$$ to run / idle

## Issues

- Deployment `vllm` is only tested on aws gpu instance `g5.2xlarge`
  - See https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/llm-on-openshift/tree/main/llm-servers/vllm
  - See https://quay.io/repository/rh-aiservices-bu/vllm-openai-ubi9
- Error: `Pipeline version cannot be rendered` when using RHOAI version `2.9.1`
  - Tekton pipelines are no longer supported in the GUI
